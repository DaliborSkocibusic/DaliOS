My Attempt at coding an OS based on the course - Udemy Developing a Multithreaded Kernel From Scratch!

https://www.udemy.com/course/developing-a-multithreaded-kernel-from-scratch/


Note this is GPL2.0 as per the original author Daniel McCarthy's PeachOS course. This content is (In a perfect world) going to end up the same as the repo below. 
In an even better world I might figure out how to do this on my own and make some modifications. This however wont happen any time soon if at all. 

https://github.com/nibblebits/PeachOS

Please note, while I did write this code, it is 100% from the course Deveveoping a Multithreaded Kernel From Scratch!

If you want to clone / fork, you are much better off doing so from the PeachOS link above as Daniel authored the course.

I more then likely will make many mistakes.

Please support Daniel if you can, the course is amazing and Daniel realy knows OS / Kernel development
