# DaliOS
My Attempt at coding an OS based on the course - Udemy Developing a Multithreaded Kernel From Scratch!

Note this is GPL as per the original author Daniel McCarthy

https://github.com/nibblebits/PeachOS

Please note, while I did write this code, it is 100% from the course Deveveoping a Multithreaded Kernel From Scratch!

If you want to clone / fork, you are much better off doing so from the PeachOS link above as Daniel authored the course.

I more then likely will make many mistakes.

Please support Daniel if you can, the course is amazing and Daniel realy knows OS / Kernel development
